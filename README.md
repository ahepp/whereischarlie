# Where is Charlie?

I'm using GitHub Actions to deploy infrastructure on AWS with CloudFormation.
CloudFormation creates an S3 bucket configured for web hosting, then Github Actions copies the static files in www to the bucket.

Next step will be to create an API to get my dog's location, and display that data on the map.
